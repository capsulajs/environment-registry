# CapsulaJS: Environment Registry

Capsula-hub will allow to load different versions of a project/service.

The aim of this service is to provide a way to register those into an environment
and to allow to access them.

This service will be able to be called by a CI-CD pipeline in order to keep at 
disposal each version of projects/services automatically after pushing 
modifications.
